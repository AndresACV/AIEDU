# Project Progress

## Completed Features and Working Components

- Initial project setup and documentation framework creation
- Comprehensive Web Application for Speech Interaction:
  - Flask-based web server with responsive UI
  - Bootstrap styling for clean, modern interface
  - Tab-based navigation between TTS and STT features

- Text-to-Speech Component (100% Functional):
  - Windows SAPI5 integration via pyttsx3
  - Multiple voice support for English and Spanish
  - Real-time audio generation and playback
  - Voice selection dropdown with automatic detection

- Speech-to-Text Component (100% Functional):
  - Offline speech recognition using Vosk (Kaldi-based)
  - Client-side audio format conversion (WebM to WAV)
  - Audio volume visualization for microphone feedback
  - Automatic download and setup of language models
  - Support for both English and Spanish recognition

## Outstanding Tasks and Pending Work

- Speech Recognition Enhancements:
  - Fine-tuning Vosk models for better recognition
  - Noise cancellation for improved accuracy
  - Additional language support
  - Extended vocabulary for specialized domains

- Speech Synthesis Improvements:
  - Integration of more advanced open-source TTS models
  - Support for voice customization and emotion
  - Improved prosody and natural speech patterns

- RAG System Core Components:
  - Embedding strategy implementation
  - Vector database integration
  - Context assembly and processing
  - LLM integration and response generation

- Application Enhancements:
  - Conversation memory and history
  - User accounts and personalization
  - Mobile-responsive design improvements
  - Performance optimization

## Overall Progress Status

The Speech Interaction System is fully functional with both text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities working in a web-based interface. The system utilizes 100% offline, open-source models and provides real-time feedback and visualization for audio processing. All core speech interaction requirements have been met.

With this solid foundation of bidirectional speech interaction, the project is now ready to move on to implementing the embedding strategy and RAG system components. The current web application provides an excellent platform for integrating these additional capabilities.
